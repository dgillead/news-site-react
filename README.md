# Overview Test

In this challenge, we will focus on creating three components that we will later use as we create a news site similar to reddit.com.

Each of the three `components` listed below has been stubbed out - your mission is to create the content that the `component` should `render`, and handle the `props` that are being passed in appropriately.

While these `components` can be viewed in your browser by running `npm run start`, there are unit tests already created that test the `component` behaviors specified below.

## Component I: ArticleTeaser
The ArticleTeaser component should accept the following `props`:
1. `id` - a number
2. `title` - a string
3. `created_date` - a string (there is a bug in the code, specifically App.js! can you find it?)
4. `handleTitleClick` - a function. Will arrow functions be useful here?

All of these `props` will always be passed in.

The `ArticleTeaser` `component` should:
1. Display the `title` inside of an `<a>` tag.
2. When the `title` `<a>` tag is clicked, it should call `this.props.handleTitleClick(this.props.id);`. Will arrow functions be useful here?
3. Display the `created_date` in a `<p>` tag.

## Component II: Article
The Article `component` should accept the following `props`:
1. `title` - a string
2. `created_date` - a string
3. `abstract` - a string
4. `byline` - a string (optional)
5. `image` - a url string (optional)

The `title`, `abstract`, and `created_date` `props` will always contain values. `image` and `byline` may be set, but they may also be null. Be sure to account for this.

The `Article` `component` should:
1. Display the `title` inside of an `<h1>` tag.
2. Display the `created_date` in a `<p>` tag.
3. Display the `byline` (if it exists) in an `<h2>` tag.
4. Display the `image` (if it exists) in an `<img>` tag (the value of `image` should be set to the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag).
5. Display the `abstract` inside of a `<p>` tag.


## Component III: Nav
The Nav `component` should accept the following `props`:
1. `navItems` - an array of navItem objects.
2. `handleNavClick` - a function. Will arrow functions be useful here?

The `Nav` `component` should return a `<nav>` `component` that contains `<a>`'s as children - one for every item in the `this.props.navItems` array.

The Nav `component` should:
1) Map through `this.props.navItems` to create an array of `<a>` elements. The objects within `this.props.navItems` look something like this:
```
{
 label: "NYREGION",
 value: "nyregion"
}
```
When transforming/mapping the `nav` item objects in `this.props.navItems` into an array of `<a>` tags, you'll want to use the `label` property (displayed in the example above) as the text that appears on screen. At the same time, you will want to attach an event handler to each `<a>`'s `onClick` event. `onClick` should call `this.props.handleNavClick`, and pass the 'value' property from the `nav` item object.
